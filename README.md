Automates the charging of monthly payers' parking lot. 

It integrates and automates the usage of two systems: 
  - one that controls the parked cars, monthly payers, their data etc;
  - antother that issues bank slips.

The tools I have used are Java and Selenium.

The basic ideia is: each day 10, 20 and 30 of the month the praking lot should issue the bank slips to the bank monthly payers.
All the data necessary to do that, as day of charging, name of the person and value to charge are in this first web app called Valeti.
So, it's possible to parse this data and auto generate the bank slips on the bank's web app.
